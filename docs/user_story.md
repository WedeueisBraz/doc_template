# User Story: Confidential Project Documentation with AI Bot

As a Senior Data Scientist at the AI4.*,
I want a specialized AI bot to assist me in generating standardized project documentation while ensuring the confidentiality of client data,
So that I can efficiently and consistently document projects across various client contexts and processes without sharing sensitive information with online or third-party tools.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Scenario 1: Initial Setup and Configuration

**Given** I am a Senior Data Scientist at the AI4.*,
**When** I access the AI bot platform installed locally on our secure servers,
**Then** I should be able to configure the bot by providing project-specific parameters, such as client name, project type, key milestones, and deliverables, within the confines of our secure environment.

### Scenario 2: Generating Project Documentation

**Given** I have configured the AI bot with relevant project parameters,
**When** I upload project-related data, such as code files, data sets, and project notes, to the locally hosted AI bot,
**Then** the AI bot should analyze the data and generate an initial draft of the project documentation, including sections for project overview, methodology, data sources, key findings, and conclusions, all while ensuring that the sensitive data remains within our secure infrastructure.

### Scenario 3: Customization and Contextualization

**Given** the AI bot has generated the initial project documentation draft,
**When** I review the draft,
**Then** I should be able to customize and contextualize the content within our secure environment, aligning it with the specific client's needs and processes while adhering to our privacy and security standards.

### Scenario 4: Iterative Collaboration

**Given** I have customized and contextualized the initial draft,
**When** I collaborate with team members or clients within our secure environment,
**Then** the AI bot should provide suggestions for further improvements, highlight missing sections, and assist in addressing specific client requirements, all while safeguarding the confidentiality of the data.

### Scenario 5: Versioning and Tracking

**Given** the project documentation is finalized and approved,
**When** I save and store the documentation within our secure infrastructure,
**Then** the AI bot should automatically version the documentation, allowing me to track changes over time and revert to previous versions if needed, while maintaining the data's privacy and security.

### Scenario 6: Continuous Learning and Improvement

**Given** I have utilized the AI bot for multiple projects,
**When** I provide feedback on the AI bot's performance and suggestions within our secure environment,
**Then** the AI bot should incorporate the feedback and continuously improve its documentation generation capabilities, adapting to different client contexts and processes, all without compromising the confidentiality of sensitive data.

### Scenario 7: Access Control and Security

**Given** the AI bot platform and data are hosted within our secure infrastructure,
**When** I access and use the AI bot within our controlled environment,
**Then** the platform should ensure strict access control and security measures to protect the confidentiality of the project information, preventing unauthorized access or data leakage.

## Additional Notes

The AI bot's primary objective is to streamline the process of confidentially documenting projects for Data Scientists, ensuring consistency while respecting client data privacy. By automating the initial draft generation and providing collaborative support within our secure environment, the AI bot aims to save time and effort in the documentation process while upholding the highest standards of privacy and security for client-sensitive information.
